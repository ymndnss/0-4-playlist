        <br>I found a love, for me
        <br>Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
        <br>Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
        <br>Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
        <br>Not knowing what it was
        <br>I will not give you up this time
        <br>But darling, just kiss me slow
        <br>Your heart is all I own
        <br>And in your eyes, you're holding mine
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
        <br>With you between my arms
        <br>Barefoot on the grass
        <br>Listening to our favourite song
        <br>When you said you looked a mess
        <br>I whispered underneath my breath
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>But you heard it
        <br>Darling, you look perfect tonight
        <br>Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
        <br>She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
        <br>I found a lover, to carry more than just my secrets
        <br>To carry love, to carry children of our own
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>We are still kids, but we're so in love
        <br>Fighting against all odds
        <br>I know we'll be alright this time
        <br>Darling, just hold my hand
        <br>Be my girl, I'll be your man
        <br>I see my future in your eyes
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
        <br>With you between my arms
        <br>Barefoot on the grass
        <br>Listening to our favorite song
        <br>When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
    </p>
    <br>I don't deserve this
    <br>Darling, you look perfect tonight
    <br>Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
    <br>With you between my arms
    <br>Barefoot on the grass
    <br>Listening to our favorite song
    <br>I have faith in what I see
    <p><br>Now I know I have met an angel in person
        <br>And she looks perfect
        <br>I don't deserve this
        <br>You look perfect tonight
