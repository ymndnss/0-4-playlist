        <br>Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
        <br>But it's the only thing that I know
        <br>When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
        <br>It is the only thing makes us feel alive
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>We keep this love in a photograph
        <br>We made these memories for ourselves
        <br>Where our eyes are never closing
        <br>Hearts are never broken
        <br>And time's forever frozen, still
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>So you can keep me
        <br>Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
        <br>Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
        <br>You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home
        <br>Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
        <br>And it's the only thing that I know, know
        <br>I swear it will get easier
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>Remember that with every piece of ya
        <br>Hmm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die
        <br>Hmm, we keep this love in a photograph
        <br>We made these memories for ourselves
        <br>Where our eyes are never closing
        <br>Hearts were never broken
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>And time's forever frozen, still
        <br>So you can keep me
        <br>Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
        <br>Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
        <br>You won't ever be alone
        <br>And if you hurt me
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>That's okay, baby, only words bleed
        <br>Inside these pages, you just hold me
        <br>And I won't ever let you go
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>Wait for me to come home
        <br>Wait for me to come home
        <br>Wait for me to come home
        <br>Wait for me to come home
        <br>Oh, you can fit me
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
        <br>Next to your heartbeat where I should be
        <br>Keep it deep within your soul
        <br>And if you hurt me
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
        <br>Inside these pages, you just hold me
        <br>And I won't ever let you go
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
        <br>Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
        <br>Hearing you whisper through the phone
        <br>"Wait for me to come home"
