        <br>Lately
        <p>
            <br>I can't help but think that our roads might take us down different phases
            <br>Don't wanna complicate the rhythm that we got but I'm speechless
            <br>When everything's so pure, can it be aimless?
            <br>Painless?
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>If you ever go
            <br>All the songs that we like
            <br>Will sound like bittersweet lullabies
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>Lost in the blue
            <br>They don't love me like you do
            <br>Those chills that I knew
            <br>They were nothing without you
            <br>And everyone else
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>They don't matter now
            <br>You're the one I can't lose
            <br>No one loves me like you do
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>Since I met you
            <br>All the gloomy days just seem to shine a little more brightly
            <br>Consider what we've got 'cause I can never take you for granted
            <br>Is there another us on this whole planet?
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>Planet?
            <br>If you ever go
            <br>All the songs that we like
            <br>Will sound like bittersweet lullabies
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>Lost in the blue
            <br>They don't love me like you do
            <br>Those chills that I knew
            <br>They were nothing without you
            <br>And everyone else
            <br>They don't matter now
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>You're the one I can't lose
            <br>No one loves me like you do
            <br>No one loves me like you do
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>I don't wanna seem foolish
            <br>When I'm jumping into this
            <br>You're all that I see
            <br>Lost in the blue
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>They don't love me like you do
            <br>Those chills that I knew
            <br>They were nothing without you
            <br>And everyone else
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>They don't matter now
            <br>You're the one I can't lose
            <br>No one loves me like you do
